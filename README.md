Note: When running the app for the first time, a pop-up message will prompt '1KeySleep' to receive buttons from any application program.

It is recommended to add an app to the 'System Preferences' -' Users and Groups' - 'Login Items' to automatically launch this program with the system.

For the packaged app, right-click on the file icon "Display Package Content" - Contents Resources and find keysetting.cfg, Open this file with a text editor, modify the key values in the first three lines, save, and then run again.  

For the py file, keysetting.cfg will be generated in the folder "../Resources" during the first run.  

Another method is to directly modify the key definitions in the py source code, which are located in <class Constants>, but the external config file will be read first when program running, so you need delete the external file 'keysetting.cfg' before run it.
